      "message": "Not sure about that, but to be honest I\u0027ve never seen this message in any log as far I can remember. I think also it\u0027s easier asking to the user for the property we want to know instead of asking for a log where we have to search for this line. In other words nothing changes for the user and everything is cleaner for us. I\u0027ll just remove this line and I won\u0027t think anymore about it.",
